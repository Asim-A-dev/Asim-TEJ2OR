# Asim's TEJ2OR Journey

Welcome to my GitHub Pages website, where I document my progress through the **TEJ2OR** course. This website is a portfolio of everything I have learned, created, and worked on throughout the course.

## Overview

The **TEJ2OR** course focuses on the fundamentals of electronics, programming, and building real-world devices. This website showcases various projects, experiments, and labs I have completed as part of this course. You can explore my work through the following sections:

- **Home**: An introduction to my journey and featured projects.
- **About**: A brief overview of who I am and my background.
- **Gallery**: A collection of images and videos showcasing my work and projects.
- **Projects**: Details of specific projects I have worked on, such as the night light system and various circuit designs.

## Projects and Assignments

1. **Real World Project**: A night light system with motion detection, created using sensors and a photoresistor.
2. **Circuit Labs**: Various experiments involving binary gates, AND/OR gates, and other circuits.
3. **Final Project**: A project involving the use of transistors and body conductivity to turn on a light by touching two wires.
